Iâ€™m Cory Sullivan and I am a Mac and iOS Software developer, living on the east coast of Canada.

I started developing later than most (I was 36). I worked as a Civil Engineer for almost 15 years but was no longer inspired or passionate about my day job. On a whim, I purchased [iOS Programming (Big Nerd Ranch)](https://www.bignerdranch.com/books/ios-programming/). I started ploughing through the chapters on weekends and evenings, although initial I found it very difficult I also found it very rewarding. Within a year I had my first job as an iOS developer.

Currently, I'm the lead iOS developer for a leading entertainment brand in the US.
